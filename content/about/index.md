  ABOUT


  Warehouse is an Amsterdam-based fashion platform that aims to create space for
  expanded fashion practices; those that are research-based, interdisciplinary
  and critically question the commercial fashion industry. Warehouse is a
  collaborative effort. It is currently run by Anouk Beckers, Elisa van Joolen,
  Élise Ory, Mika Perlmutter and Femke de Vries. Chinouk Filique de Miranda
  develops our podcast. Zuzana Kostelanská created our visual identity and
  supports all things related to graphic design. Chet Bugter was part of the
  Warehouse team from 2019 till 2022 and, as a co-founder, Hanka van der Voet
  was a member from 2018 till 2023.
